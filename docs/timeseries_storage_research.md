5. **Cost Effective**: Both are fully open source with no licensing costs

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: File-based Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Use Polars for data ingestion and initial processing
- Store bronze data as Parquet files with date partitioning  
- Implement basic corporate actions adjustment logic
- Create data quality validation pipeline

**Phase 2: DuckDB Integration (Weeks 3-4)**
